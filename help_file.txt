Title

    stackedev -- Implements a stacked event study.


Syntax

        stackedev {outcome} {leads_lags_list} [if] [in] [weight] , cohort(variable) time(variable) never_treat(variable) unit_fe(variable) clust_unit(variable) [options]

    	where leads_lags_list is the list of relative time indicators as you would have included in the canonical event study e.g.
 
                [pre3 pre2 post0 post1 [...]] 

    stackedev requires avar (Baum and Schaffer, 2013) and reghdfe (Sergio, 2017) to be installed.

    options                     Description
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Must specify.
      cohort(varname)           A categorical variable equal to the time that the unit first received treatment. It must be missing for never treated units

      time(varname)   	       A numerical variable equal to time.

      never_treat(varname)      A binary indicator that equals one if a unit never received treatment and zero if it did.

      unit_fe(varname)          A variable indicating unit fixed effects.

      clust_unit(varname)       A variable indicating the unit by which to cluster variances.

    Optional
      covariates(varlist)       A variable list of covariates.

      other_fe(varlist)         A additional fixed effects added to reghdfe's absorb option.

      interact_cov(string)      A indicate yes to interact covariates with stack.

    Saved Output
    stackedev uses reghdfe which stores results in e(b), e(V), and e(dof_table).

Description

    Implements the stacked event study estimator discussed in Cunningham (2021) and Baker (2021) and implemented in Cengiz et al. (2010). The package appends together individual datasets
    or stacks. Each stack includes all observations from a cohort of units that receive treatment in the same time period and all units that never received treatment. Effects are
    identified within each stack by comparing an individual cohort of treated units to never treated units. That approach avoids erroneous comparisons of late to early implementing units
    that may bias Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) estimates if effects vary across treated cohorts (Goodman-Bacon, 2021). The stacked event study is estimated in three steps. First, individual
    stacks are created. Second, they are appended together. Finally the package estimates an event study via reghdfe that includes unit by stack fixed effects, time by stack fixed
    effects, and standard errors clustering on unit by stack.


Example

Read in simulated state policy dataset
use "https://github.com/joshbleiberg/stackedev/raw/main/state_policy_effect.dta", clear

drop treat_year-post3

Assigning treatment to states staggered across time. It must be missing for never treated units.
gen treat_year=.
replace treat_year=2006 if inrange(state,13,20)
replace treat_year=2007 if inrange(state,21,25)
replace treat_year=2008 if inrange(state,26,40)
replace treat_year=2009 if inrange(state,40,50)

label variable treat_year "Cohort"

Creating ever treated indicator
gen ever=0
replace ever=1 if inrange(state,13,50) 
label variable ever "Ever Treated"

Creating never treated indicator that equals one if a unit never received treatment and zero if it did.
gen no_treat=ever
recode no_treat (0=1) (1=0)
label variable no_treat "Never Treated"

Creating leads and lags
gen rel=(year-treat_year)+1
replace rel=0 if ever==0
tab rel, gen(rel_)
label variable rel "Relative Time"

rename rel_1 pre8
rename rel_2 pre7
rename rel_3 pre6
rename rel_4 pre5
rename rel_5 pre4
rename rel_6 pre3
rename rel_7 pre2
rename rel_8 ref
rename rel_9 post1
rename rel_10 post2
rename rel_11 post3
rename rel_12 post4
rename rel_13 post5

label variable pre8 "Pre 8"
label variable pre7 "Pre 7"
label variable pre6 "Pre 6"
label variable pre5 "Pre 5"
label variable pre4 "Pre 4"
label variable pre3 "Pre 3"
label variable pre2 "Pre 2"
label variable ref "Base Year"
label variable post1 "Post 1"
label variable post2 "Post 2"
label variable post3 "Post 3"
label variable post4 "Post 4"
label variable post5 "Post 5"

Run the stacked event study
